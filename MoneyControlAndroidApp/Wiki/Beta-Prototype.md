### Overview

We have reached very close to the end of our application development. All the user stories were implemented into working prototypes. Hence, we have reached phase in the cycle where our application needs rigorous testing so as to provide a seamless and unparalleled experience to our customers. We have used various testing methods are all these are explained in great detail in this blog.


### General Test Process

As far as our testing is concerned, we have followed Condition Coverage Technique and Branch Coverage Technique for the White Box testing and for Black Box testing, we have followed the equivalence partitioning technique:

### Testing Process

Major testing techniques which are available at our disposal are the following:

- **Unit Testing** - Testing is carried out by the developer after the completion of a module or functionality.
- **System Testing** - Testing is carried out by a test analyst only for the module or functionality
- **System Integration Testing**- Testing is carried out by a test analyst after all the modules are integrated.
- **Acceptance Testing** - Testing is carried out by a user for the entire functionality of the application or module.

White box comprises of Unit testing and other techniques such as System Testing and Acceptance Testing, Integration Testing are classified under Black Box Testing.



### White Box Testing

This method of testing is from the developers' point of view. It enables the developer to check the flow of control of the line of codes through various loops and code structures. For the developers to use this method, they can follow the below two simple steps:

- First to get the complete working knowledge of the written code.
- To select the most suitable coverage technique, that is applicable to the written code.



### White Box Testing Techniques

There exist many coverage techniques for the developers to scrutinize blocks of written codes. They are:

- **Statement Coverage** - Tests each statement at least once. The main idea is to cover all executable statements inside the given block of code and check them with test cases.
- **Function coverage** -Tests each function at least once.
- **Edge coverage** -Tests every edge in the control flow graph in the program at least once
- **Branch coverage** -Tests every control statement in the program at least once.
- **Condition coverage** - Tests every boolean sub-expression whether evaluated to both true and false.

The following classes were tested using White Box Testing:



#### Field Validation while saving transactions:

##### Category Class Validation

### Black Box Testing 

Black Box Testing is a testing technique in which the functionality of the application is tested without knowing the internal code or the underlying structure. The tests can be functional or non-functional.

### Types of Black Box Testing

- **Functional Testing:** Usually performed by Test Analysts to check the functionality of the application based on the requirements received

- **Non-Functional Testing:**This testing focuses on the performance, usability, and scalability of the application

- **Regression Testing:** Testing done immediately after making any changes to the source code whether to know if all the earlier working functionalities are in place and has no impact on any of the functionalities done earlier

  

### Black Box Testing Types

- **Equivalence Partitioning:** It is a test design technique that involves dividing input valid and invalid partitions and selecting particular values from each partition as test data.

- **Boundary Value Analysis:** It is a test design technique that involves the determination of boundaries for input values and selecting values that are at the boundaries and just inside/outside of the boundaries as test data.

- **Cause-Effect Graphing:** It is a test design technique that involves identifying the case and effects producing a Cause-Effect Graph.
